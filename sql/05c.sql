 * You also like the acting in the movies ACADEMY DINOSAUR and AGENT TRUMP,

 * Write a SQL query that lists all movies where at least 3 actors were in one of the above three movies.
 * (The actors do not necessarily have to all be in the same movie, and you do not necessarily need one actor from each movie.)
